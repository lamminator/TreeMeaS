# TreeMeaS (Tree Measurement Sampling Tool)
Android-Based APP for Horizontal Point Sampling (HPS), borderline factor, and upper-stem diameter estimation.

## Objectives
1. HPS: Pitch-calibrated angle gauge APP.

2. Upper-Stem Diameter: Measure upper-stem diameter for better volume estimation.

### WHY DO WE NEED THIS? 
1. Forest mensuration usually face the slope problem when doing HPS, we can't get the correct gauge width when we are on a slope, especially in Taiwan.
2. Upper-stem diameter is a critical attribute of the forest. However, it is often neglected in Taiwan.
3. Borderline factor is useful for Critical Height Sampling.
4. Digital Suunto for height measurement.

### AS A RESULT
1. We need the pitch angle calibration for the HPS gauge.
2. Based on 1. and other geometric methods, we can get a transformation for upper-stem diameter to horizontal diameter.

### Technology
1. Android APP.
2. IMU in mobile phone for orientation.
3. Develop the pitch calibration mathematical formula for upper-stem diameter measurement.
